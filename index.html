        <h2>What Is Clean Coal?</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear is woke. We all know it. The Solution? Clean Coal. It's got everything
            great from coal, but it's clean! I'm not sure how, but the trump administration has
            told me that, so I will believe it with all my heart!
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Why is it based?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emission Reduction:</strong> Technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) can significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Reliability:</strong> Coal can provide steady, high-output electricity, which some regions rely on for grid stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution Control:</strong> Modern scrubbers and filters can reduce pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Transition:</strong> Clean-coal methods can be used as interim solutions for regions dependent on coal while transitioning to cleaner energy sources.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Clean-coal technologies can reduce emissions and pollution to 0! They DO eliminate
            them completely, and the Libs will lie to you and say that's wrong, but they're fake news!
