        <h2>What Is Clean Coal?</h2>
        <p>
            “Clean coal” refers to a collection of technologies designed to reduce the environmental
            impact of coal-based energy. These approaches focus on lowering emissions, improving
            efficiency, and capturing pollutants that would otherwise enter the atmosphere.

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Why Some Consider It Valuable</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emission Reduction:</strong> Technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) can significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Reliability:</strong> Coal can provide steady, high-output electricity, which some regions rely on for grid stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution Control:</strong> Modern scrubbers and filters can reduce pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Transition:</strong> Clean-coal methods can be used as interim solutions for regions dependent on coal while transitioning to cleaner energy sources.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            While clean-coal technologies can reduce emissions and pollution, they do not eliminate
            them completely. Carbon capture systems can be expensive and energy-intensive, and many
            experts argue that long-term sustainability depends on broader shifts to low-carbon energy
            sources. This context helps provide a full picture of how clean coal fits into modern
            energy strategies.
